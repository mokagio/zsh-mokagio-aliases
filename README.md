zsh-moka-aliases
================

Just some aliases for the [zsh](git@github.com:mokagio/zsh-moka-aliases.git) terminal, to speedup the work.

_Note_ The zsh setup these aliases are working on is zsh + [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto), I haven't tried them with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), but _they should work anyway_

**Use them at your own risk!**

###Usage

Just `source` `zsh_moka_aliases.zsh` in your `.zshrc` to get the whole bundle, or the single files if you need only some of them.

###A note

I'd be really happy if you used my aliases, and maybe tell me what you think, but it would be better if you'd use these as a template for your own custom aliases. Aliases should be personal, and the process of setting them up is very important to memorize them.
